	// Technically, instability is defined with respect to the production rules,
	// which we do not have yet. We only have partial production rules that make
	// up the transitions in the HSE graph. Previous version have used the firing
	// history to try to guess at further terms that might be found in the
	// production rule to identify unstable variables sooner in the flow. This
	// functionality has currently been commented out as a result of a refactor
	// and rework of the underlying engine. It is unclear whether this
	// functionality needs to be explored further or whether doing so would be
	// incorrect.

	// See todo in simulator.cpp

	// Remember these pointers so that we do not have to include them as inputs
	// to every simulation step. graph is the HSE we are simulating, and
	// variables keeps a mapping from variable name to index in a minterm.
	graph *base;

	// The encoding is a minterm that records our knowledge about the current
	// value of each variable in the circuit.

	// Each variable can be one of four possible values:
	// '0' - GND
	// '1' - VDD
	// '-' - unknown (either 0 or 1)
	// 'X' - unstable or interfering (neither 0 nor 1) 

	// Unfortunately, a single variable might exist in multiple isochronic
	// domains. This means that the wire represented by the variable is long
	// enough that a transition on one end of the wire takes a significant amount
	// of time to propagate to the other end of the wire. Each end of that wire
	// is considered to be an isochronic domain, a section in which the
	// transition is assumed to propogate across atomically relative to
	// other events.

	// So when a transition happens on one end of the wire, we don't actually
	// know when it will arrive at the other end. This means that we lose
	// knowledge about the value at the other end of the wire, it becomes '-' in the encoding.

	// Therefore, the global encoding records not just our knowledge of the
	// current value of each wire, but records what all isochronic domains of
	// each variable will be given enough time. This means that the global
	// encoding does not lose knowledge about the value of any variable. Instead
	// the transition is assumed to happen atomically across all isochronic
	// domains.

	// This is used to determine if there is a transition in one isochronic
	// domain that interferes with a transition in another.

// TODO CHP Simulator
//
// Our goal is to build a reliable simulator for Communicating Hardware
// Processes. We currently have a basic parser set up in haystack/lib/parse_chp
// that fills in the graph in haystack/lib/chp/chp/graph.h using functions
// defined in haystack/lib/interpret_chp. The state assignments is somewhat
// filled out in haystack/lib/arithmetic with it's own parser
// haystack/parse_arithmetic and interpreter haystack/interpret_arithmetic.
//
// This simulator should look and feel a lot like the HSE simulator in
// haystack/lib/chp/chp/simulator.cpp. So use that has an example for how to
// approach some of the problems you'll encounter. However, as you get into the
// problem, you'll encounter a whole list of new ones.
//
// The following steps are guidelines and not hard rules. If you think you
// found a better way to approach the problem, then feel free to chase that
// down. If you need supporting infrastructure anywhere else in the project,
// feel free to add that in. If you need to modify this function definition,
// go for it.
//
// 1. Fill out chp::graph as needed
//   a. Work with team members to identify shared and unique requirements for the
//      CHP graph class
//   b. Create the data structures necessary to implement those requirements
//
// 2. Learn some of the underlying infrastructure
//   a. Create tests for the expression and assignment evaluation engine
//   b. Fill in gaps for operator evaluation
//   c. Implement channel action evaluation
//
// 3. Create a skeleton for the simulator, copying some from
//    haystack/lib/chp/chp/simulator.cpp
//   a. create a function that identifies enabled transitions
//   b. Call upon arithmetic::local_action to update the current state with a
//      selected enabled transitionâ€™s action
//
// 4. Clean up haystack/bin/chpsim to build an interactive simulation
//    environment that works with the CHP simulator
//
// === Successful completion of project ===
// 
// Your time is yours, what do you want to tackle next?
// Some ideas:
// 1. Looking at haystack/lib/chp/chp/elaborator.cpp, implement a space
//    exploration algorithm to work with the CHP simulator for verification
// 2. Add support for more complex types than just integer. Create a type
//    system and update the parser to support it.
// 3. Add support for more than just one neutral state.
// 4. Add support for user defined channel protocols.
//
// Final cleaup:
// 1. Clean up any bugs
// 2. Prepare demo
// 3. Document as needed
